### At startup, the program will prompt you to enter a start url for the search, a search phrase, the depth and number of download threads.
### The search will be performed on the page graph. The concept of depth is shown in the image below.
* Depth 1 - start url, 
* 2 - all urls found on the start page,
* 3 - all urls found on the pages above,
* etc.
